# recurtools

So many questions on StackExchange take the form "How do I ... with a nested list?".
Here are some tools and helpers I developed to solve those kinds of problems

Currently this includes:

- `flatten` to flatten sequences recursively
- `chainanything` to chain (m)anything(s)
- recursive versions of `len`, `sum`, `count`, `in` and `index`

**WARNING** This is a 0.x.x version because I am not yet happy with the function naming. Expect the API to change.
